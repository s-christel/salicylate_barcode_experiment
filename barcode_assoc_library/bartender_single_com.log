Loading barcodes from the file
It takes 00:00:01 to load the barcodes from 145_R1_001.extract_barcode.txt
Shortest barcode length: 20
Longest barcode length: 20
Start to group barcode with length 20
Using two sample unpooled test
Transforming the barcodes into seed clusters
Initial number of unique reads:  60086
The distance threshold is 2
Clustering iteration 1
Clustering iteration 2
Clustering iteration 3
Clustering iteration 4
Identified 6787 barcodes with length 20
The clustering process takes 00:00:00
Start to dump clusters to file with prefix 145_R1_001.extract.cluster
Start to remove pcr effects
***(Overall error rate estimated from the clustering result)***
Total number of clusters after removing PCR effects: 6787
The estimated error rate is 0.00299747
