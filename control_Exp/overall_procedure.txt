- Create metadata spreadsheets (one for libraries and one for each experiment)
- Collect/concatenate sequence files as necessary
- Calculate read numbers for each samples
- Incorporate read numbers into metadata spreadsheets
- Separate libraries and seqs for each experiment in separate directories
- Separately commence bartender analysis
- Analyze library_seqs to create a Barcode/Genotype dictionary (barcode_metadata.csv). This includes discarding all barcodes that have more than one genotype assigned to them
- Copy Barcode/Genotype dictionary to experimental sample analysis directories
- Anaylze experimental samples
